# Zabo NYC Demo

We will be using this project to develop an app connecting to crypto wallets using Zabo, for the July 15 NYC Blockchain Dev meetup. To prepare in advance, clone this repo to your machine.   

Also, be sure to have a server installed to deliver HTML files from. If you don't have one, options are:   

* [Nodejs live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)
* [Python SimpleHTTPServer](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/modules-in-python/how-to-use-simplehttpserver/)
* [Visual Studio Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)   

See you there!
